Skin pack made by **Fontes** for the RetroFW firmware that goes on some emulator handhelds. However, it will work on just about anything that runs the GMenu2x/GMenuNX frontend, minus a few minor iconography inconsistencies.

Some of the handhelds this will work on include:
- LDK
- RS97 Retrogame
- Bittboy V2

You can download the Skin Pack [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FuVmCVel9MvcO7ViNFqWUSS7DUMNkaqU/view?usp=sharing)

To install simply copy the files in the same order as the **.zip** contents.
